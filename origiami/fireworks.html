  <figcaption align="center">The origami FIREWORKS is a gorgeous piece of paper sculpture. If I did a better job at it, you'll be able to tell. However, you can just see how awesome it can really be if all the cuts and creases were done perfectly. Yes, there are a couple of cuts you'll have to make, but they're very minor and really helps define the figure of an FIREWORKS.
This origami FIREWORKS is not hard to make at all. Folding the wings were a little awkward, but really cool when you see them take shape. The FIREWORKS is really fun to fold and cool to look at.
