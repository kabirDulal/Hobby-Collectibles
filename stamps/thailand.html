  <figcaption align="center">This stamp is of THAILAND which will be used for postal purpose.THAILAND is an island city-state off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, 137 km north of the equator, south of the THAILANDn state of Johor and north of THAILAND's Riau Islands. THAILAND is the smallest nation in Southeast Asia.

The island rose in importance during the 14th century and became an important port until it was destroyed by Portuguese raiders in 1613. In 1819 the Englishman Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles established a British trading post on the island. Under British colonial rule, THAILAND grew in importance rapidly becoming a major port city. During World War II, THAILAND was occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945. After the war, Singapore reverted to British control, with increasing levels of self-government being granted, culminating in Singapore's merger with the Federation of Malaya to form THAILAND in 1963. Singapore became an independent republic on 9 August 1965.
