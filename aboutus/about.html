<div class="about-main">
<div class="about_aim"> 
<h3>Aim</h3>
<p class="paim">HObby and Collectibles is simply dummy text of the product sales industry.HObby and Collectibles has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing HObby and Collectibles passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of HObby and Collectibles</p>

<div class="about_aim"> 
<h3> Goal </h3>
<p "class="paim">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using HObby and Collectibles is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use HObby and Collectibles as their default model text, and a search for HObby and Collectibles' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
